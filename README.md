# Finite Difference Methods: Laplace's and Maxwell's Equations

## Introduction
This repository contains two MATLAB projects demonstrating the application of finite difference methods:

1. __Laplace's Equation Solver:__ Implements the finite difference method (FDM) to solve Laplace's equation in a 2D grid. This simulation is used to determine the potential distribution in a rectangular domain with specified boundary conditions.

2. __Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Simulation:__ Implements the FDTD method to solve Maxwell's equations in a one-dimensional domain. This simulation includes Mur's absorbing boundary conditions to model wave propagation and absorption.

Both projects are designed to provide a practical understanding of these numerical methods and their applications in computational physics.
## Objectives
- Implement the Finite Difference Method to solve Poisson's and Laplace's equations.
- Apply the Finite Difference Time Domain method to simulate electromagnetic wave propagation.
- Develop MATLAB scripts for solving differential equations and simulating time-domain behavior.
## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

* `Laplace.m` - MATLAB script to solve Laplace's equation using the finite difference method.
* `TimeDomain.m` - MATLAB script to solve Maxwell's equations using the finite difference time domain method.
## Features

### Laplace's Equation Solver
* Solves Laplace's equation using a grid-based finite difference method.
* Allows user-defined boundary conditions for potential on the edges of the grid.
* Provides visualization of the potential distribution using a 3D surface plot.

### Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Simulation

* Solves Maxwell's equations in a 1D domain using the FDTD method with leap-frog scheme.
* Implements Mur's absorbing boundary conditions to model wave absorption.
* Plots the electric and magnetic field intensities over time to visualize wave propagation.
## Technologies Used

* __MATLAB:__ The primary programming environment for implementing the finite difference methods and simulations.
* __MATLAB Plotting Functions:__ For visualization of results and field distributions.
